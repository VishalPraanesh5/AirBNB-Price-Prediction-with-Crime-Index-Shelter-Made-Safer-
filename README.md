Airbnb, a pioneer in travel accommodation industry has created a platform for the people to list, discover, and book unique accommodations around the world. The company does not own any lodging; it is merely a broker and receives percentage service fees (commissions) from both guests and hosts in conjunction with every booking. It has over 3,000,000 lodging listings in 65,000 cities and 191 countries, and the cost of lodging is set by the host.
