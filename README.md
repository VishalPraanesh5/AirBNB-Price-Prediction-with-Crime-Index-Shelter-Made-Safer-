# AirBNB Price Prediction with CrimeIndex (Shelter Made Safer)


The emergence of sharing accommodation via online marketplaces have drastically changed the travel accommodation industry in the recent past. Airbnb,
a pioneer in travel accommodation industry has created a platform for the people to list, discover, and book unique accommodations around the world. 
The company does not own any lodging; it is merely a broker and receives percentage service fees (commissions) from both guests and hosts in
conjunction with every booking. It has over 3,000,000 lodging listings in 65,000 cities and 191 countries, and the cost of lodging is set by the host. This
project revolves around this concept of shared economy and helps the user in predicting optimal price for the listings and safety level of the neighborhood.

This project analyzes the Airbnbâ€™s complete listings of New York city to predict whether the price set by the host is optimal. It considers various attributes like
number of rooms, availability, location, people allowed and many more to predict the price. Parallel to this, the crime data of the city is clustered based on the
neighborhood, location and crime-type. This acquired classifiers are then put together with the Airbnb listings to provide better results for the user in terms of
predicting accommodation with cheap pricing to safer neighborhood. In a nutshell, this project helps the guests to check how safe and cheap are the
listings posted onto the Airbnb website.
